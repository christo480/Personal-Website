    "DRACONIC WINGS\nSome dragonborn are born with draconian wings. They tend to have slender frames and smooth scale patterns, along with a long rudder-like tail to help them fly with their stocky wings. They’re far too heavy and lack the strength to really soar like true dragons, but their wings still allow them to lift off and fly a considerable distance before tiring.\nFlight. You have a fly speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor. Whenever you spend 3 full consecutive rounds airborne without landing, you gain a level of fatigue . Any fatigue gained in this way is removed upon finishing a short or long rest.",

  "Culture": "There are many circumstances in which a great wyrm might choose to sire a clutch of dragonborn, and the resulting dragonborn clans are as varied as their progenitors. Ultimately though, the life and society of each dragonborn clan is inexorably linked to the dragon that created it.\nChromatic dragons usually see dragonborn as soldiers, cannon fodder to be created and spent for power and territory. Such militarized dragonborn clans tend to see their progenitor as a mighty general and inspiring leader who will guide them to glorious victory, often against dragonborn created by rival dragons. Such dragonborn clans are usually brutal, fearless, and blindly obedient to their progenitor.\nEssence dragons fly wingless over distant shores, their serpentine pennant-like bodies snapping back and forth magically as they soar. Their spirits are intertwined with the magic of the land and are usually tied to a specific sea, river, or mountain, or to a separate plane entirely. Essence dragons see their dragonborn as trusted guardians and custodians, charging them with the safety and protection of the place from which they draw their power. Such dragonborn clans are often highly attuned to nature, and guard their progenitor’s home at all costs.\nGem dragons are rarely seen by surface dwellers and the same is true about their dragonborn. These wyrms live deep within the earth, sometimes for isolation and escape but often pursuing their own esoteric games and schemes millennia in the making. They see their dragonborn as agents, spies, and confidants. Their dragonborn are afforded an unusual level of respect, as they’re often the only creatures a gem dragon trusts enough to include wholly into its schemes. Such dragonborn clans are tight-knit but widely dispersed, often spending years in isolation only to reconvene when the time is right.\nMetallic dragons tend to see their dragonborn as children, regardless of their age. To the outside observer, they often seem like the dragon’s servants, and functionally they often are, but the relationship is more parental than feudal—for some, a more intolerable condition since their unquestioning service is rewarded with condescension and infantilization. Despite all this, such dragonborn clans are typically academic, studious, and often a voice of calm and reason when conflicts arise.",
  "Suggested Cultures": "While you can choose any culture for your dragonborn character, the dragonbound and dragoncult cultures are linked closely with this heritage ."
